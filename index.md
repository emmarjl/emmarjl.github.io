### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because of the amount of if statements that went into the program. I didn't really understand if statements at first, however, by doing it over and over again in this lab, I started to become a little more familiar with how it works. This lab taught me a lot about if statements and the little details of how they are used properly. The Hi-Lo game was also something I was familiar with and something that is generally pretty logical, which made the process easier for me to understand.
