### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was interesting to me because of the amount of if statements that went into the program. It taught me a lot about if statements and how they work, like how the order affects the outcome. The Hi-Lo game was also something I was familiar with and something that is generally pretty logical, which made the process easier for me to understand.
